# VersionControlSystem

- No UI console only

- You have five commands in this application.
- config -> get and set a username (config Martin)
- add -> add a file to the index.txt (add example.txt)
- log -> show commit logs (log)
- commit -> save changes (commit example.txt)
- checkout -> restore a file (checkout (number of the commit))

-At the first launch of this application a vcs directory will be generated and in this a different files like:
- config.txt -> where the name will be saved.
- index.txt -> where the names of the tracked files will be saved.
- log.txt -> everything what happened since the file is generated.
- commits folder -> where all the commits with there generated number will be stored

- When you want to store a file in your Version-Control-System you have to store it somewhere in the project-folder
